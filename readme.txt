HI if you read this,i hope you are doing great and i apologies in advance
 
 if you need to change somethings here some info that i wanted to share that might help you to do it.
 - first of all im using a free template due to short time period given
 - the id for html and css especially might be quite dizzy for you to see it
 - i dint change much css file i only add, so the rest from the template original code is still there
 - i just make a change in the html file so most of the id im using the original template
 - the function most of it i create my ownself it not from template original
 - if you want to see the code for converter csv and json you can find in "scriptHTML.js" file 
 - oh btw for display template like json and csv i dint write a function i just do it manually. you can find in the database.html i dint seperate the script into different file
 - the language that i use is css, html, node.js and the server is using express framework server.
 - ALL THE BEST sorry for unconvinience we still intern and we are not focusing on software developer so hope you understand.
